Lab 2: Linked Lists

This lab and code is meant to explore linked lists. Linked lists will be implemented with their relevant functions, such as lookup, printlist, insert, etc.

MyNode.java defines the node. MyLinkedList.java includes the interface for the linked list. LinkedListImp.java implements the methods for the linked list. TestLab02.java tests to check if the implementation of the linked list works.
