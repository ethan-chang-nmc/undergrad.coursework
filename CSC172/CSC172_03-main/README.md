Lab 3: Infix Calculator

This lab and code is meant to create an infix calculator using stack and queue abstract data types. Conversions from infix to postifix using stacks and storage in reverse polish notation are implemented with queues to evaluate the equation. User input MUST be in the form "number SPACE operand SPACE number".

Examples from the Data Structures and Algorithms zyBook by Roman Lysecky and Frank Vahid was referenced when writing this code. 

List of file headers and what is in each file: <br/>
***CalItoP.java*** changes user infix notation to postfix notation <br/>
***CalLinkedList.java*** implements a linked list data structure and associated methods <br/>
***CalMain.java prompts*** the user for input and gives the output <br/>
***CalNode.java defines*** basic node structure used for linked list <br/>
***CalPostfix.java calculate*** the computed value from the postfix notation <br/>
***CalQueue.java*** implements a queue adt and associated methods <br/>
***CalSolution.java*** contains the method which uses methods in other classes to get the postfix notation and calculate the value <br/>
***CalStack.java*** implements a stack adt and associated methods
