Lab 1: Java Refresher

This lab and code is meant to go over the basics of Java coding. Creating methods and implementing them to solve simple problems will be the main goal of this lab. Lab01.java contains methods getMax and printArray, implemented using different techniques. In main there is also a coded function findMax that takes char array inputs and outputs the maximum char.
